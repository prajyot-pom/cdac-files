	 - pipe() creates a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used for inter‚Äê
	 process communication.
	 - the array pipefd is used to return two file descriptors referring to the ends
	 of the pipe.
	 - pipefd[0] refers to the read end of the pipe.
	 - pipefd[1] refers to the write end of the pipe.
	 - data written to the write end of the pipe is buffered by the kernel until it
	 is read from the read end of the pipe.
	 - return value: int
	 on success 0 is returned
	 on error -1 is returned
