# OS Concepts Linux Programming:
Lab Work: 01 -- Linux Commands

 - open terminal:
 	cntl+alt+t
 - to display path of the current directory/location
 	$pwd
 - command name -- "pwd" - print/present working directory
 	- this command displays absolute path (full path) of the present working directory
	- pwd comamand internally refers the value of shell variable by the name "PWD".

 - create a new directory in a home directory named as -- "os/linux_commands"
 	$mkdir -p os/linux_commands
 - create dir's by the name one, two and three
 	$mkdir one two three
 - to check dir's got created or not
 	$ls
 - goto the dir one
 	$cd one
 - goto to the previously accessed directory
 	$cd -
 - create a new file by the name "file.txt" and enter your name personal information into it
 	$cat > file.txt
 	sachin pawar
 	sunbeam karad, pune.
 
 - press (cntrl+d) to stop writing the contents into the file ( i.e. to enter end of file character into the file.
 - to display contents of the file
 	$cat file.txt
 - to display contents of the file in a reverse order
 	$tac file.txt
 - to append data into the file "file.txt"
 	$cat >> file.txt
 	algorithms and data structures
 	operating system concepts and linux programming
 	(cntrl+d)
 - create two more files "file2.txt" and "file3.txt"
	file2.txt contents are:
		c programming language
		java programming lanaguage
		c++ programming language
		advanced web programming
	file3.txt contents are:
		android programming
		iphone programming
		mobile computing technologies
 - enter the following command:
 	$cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
 - cat command used to concatenate contents of the file/s and display on the terminal
 - display contents of the current directory by using following commands and observe
 	$ls --> it displays bydefualt contents of the current dir in a columnwise sorted manner
 	$ls <dirpath> -- it displays contents of the "dirpath" whereas "dirpath" may be either an
 	absolute path or a relative path.
 	$ls -l <dirpath> --> it displays contents of the dir in a listing format
 	$ls -a <dirpath>--> it displays all the contents of the current dir including hidden files
 	$ls -A <dirpath> --> it displays all the contents of the current dir including hidden files except two entries [ "." -> current dir and ".." parent dir ]
 	$ls -R <dirpath> --> to display contents of the directory recursively
	
  	- explore other options of "ls" command with the help of "man" command
  - "man" command is a system manual pager i.e. online help of linux system which is used to
  display information about commands/library functions/system calls etc...
  	$man ls --> to display information about "ls" command - bydefualt it displays information
  	user commands from section-1 of manual pages.
  	
  	$man 1 mkdir --> to display information about "mkdir" command
  	$man 2 _exit --> to display information about _exit() system call
  	$man 3 printf --> to display information about printf() library functions
  	etc...
  	
  	- explore man command with the following command
  		$man man
  		
  	- command name -- "cd"
  	- this command used to change the directory
  	$cd <dirpath> --> change directory to the "dirpath"
  	$cd . --> change dir to the current directory
  	$cd .. --> change dir to its parent directory
  	$cd / --> cd . --> change dir to the root directory
  	$cd ~ --> change dir to the home directory
  	$cd - --> change dir to the previously accessed dir

	- command name -- "mkdir" - this command is used to create directory/directories
	$mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 --> createa 3 dir's in the current directory
	$mkdir -p first second third --> creates directories recursively
	- display contents of the current directory recursively.
		$ls -R
	
	- command name -- "rmdir" -  this command is used to remove directory
		$rmdir <dirpath> --> to remove empty directory only
		$rm -r <dirpath> --> to remove the contents of the dir recursively
	- comamnd name -- "touch" - change the file timestamps
	- $touch india.txt --> timestamps of a file "india.txt" gets changes if it exists, if it
	is not exists new file named as "india.txt" gets created having size 0.
	- command name -- "cp" - copy files and directories
	- command name -- "mv" - move file/files from one location to another location
		$mv <filepath> <dest_dir_path>
		- also can be used to rename the file if filepath is exists in a dest_dir_path itself.
